### Description

This project demonstrates steganography.

Steganography is a method to hide something in something else.

In this case we hide a text message in a picture.

The need for steganography will probably increase the next few years,

because governments want to restrict cryptography.

Steganography allows you to send your secrets in a picture, making it

less suspicious.

It is very hard (impossible?) to detect if there is a message hidden

in a picture using this method, because the locations where the bits

are stored are determined by a password. Without this password you

cannot tell where the bits are stored.

Please vote for this code if you like it!
